# Authentication And Profile Observability Specification

This document defines the observability contract for the authentication, onboarding, and profile flows currently implemented in this repository.

It is intentionally scoped to the flows that already exist in source code today:

- password sign-up
- Google sign-up
- email confirmation
- password sign-in
- Google sign-in
- sign-in failure processing
- password reset request
- password reset OTP delivery
- password reset completion
- sign-out
- session refresh
- session refresh post-processing
- profile update
- avatar upload

Payments are not covered here yet.

## Goals

The observability model should answer three classes of questions:

1. Outcome / correctness
2. Flow progression
3. Technical health

For the currently implemented scope, the most important business questions are:

- Are users successfully signing up?
- Are users receiving and completing email confirmation?
- Are users successfully signing in?
- Are password reset journeys completing?
- Are session refresh and sign-out behaving correctly?
- Are authenticated users able to update their profile and avatar?

## Design Rules

### Event names carry the meaning

Custom event names are the primary business signal.

Examples:

- `PasswordSignUpStarted`
- `PasswordSignUpCompleted`
- `GoogleSignInStarted`
- `GoogleSignInCompleted`

Do not encode redundant state like `outcome`, `source`, `auth_method`, `provider`, or `endpoint` as custom-event properties when the event name already expresses that meaning.

### Use a small, stable property set

Custom event payloads should stay minimal.

Current standard properties:

- `flow.id`
- `correlation_id`
- `tenant_id`
- `stakeholder_id`
- `failure_reason`

Only include `failure_reason` when a failure reason is actually needed.

### Distinguish journey IDs from transport correlation

- `flow.id` is the customer-journey identifier.
- `correlation_id` is the request/message correlation identifier.

They are related but not the same thing.

Use `flow.id` to follow a single user journey across:

- WebAPI
- outbox / broker
- consumer

Use `correlation_id` to correlate one request/message execution.

### Do not invent telemetry context after the fact

- If a consumer message does not inherit from `BaseCommand` or `BaseEvent`, it is invalid for the shared consumer pipeline.
- If a consumer message has no `FlowId`, keep `flow.id` empty.
- Do not synthesize a new customer-journey identifier inside consumer handling.

### Keep failure reasons low-cardinality

Failure reasons must come from shared constants and remain query-friendly.

Current shared source:

- `ObservabilityFailureReasons`

## Current Shared Constants

The current source-of-truth constants live in:

- [Observability.cs](/C:/Work/Chidelu/TMG/src/TMG.Domain/Common/Observability/Observability.cs)
- [ObservabilityFailureReasons.cs](/C:/Work/Chidelu/TMG/src/TMG.Domain/Common/Observability/ObservabilityFailureReasons.cs)

## Standard Property Contract

### Required on custom events

- `flow.id`
- `correlation_id`

### Include when known

- `tenant_id`
- `stakeholder_id`

### Include only when relevant

- `failure_reason`

### Avoid by default

- raw email address
- IP address
- user agent
- endpoint
- auth method
- provider
- source
- outcome

Those values may still exist in logs or technical traces, but they are not part of the standard business custom-event payload by default.

## Event Taxonomy

These are the current business custom events for the implemented scope.

### Authentication

- `PasswordSignUpStarted`
- `PasswordSignUpCompleted`
- `PasswordSignUpFailed`
- `GoogleSignUpStarted`
- `GoogleSignUpCompleted`
- `GoogleSignUpFailed`
- `EmailConfirmationOtpSent`
- `EmailConfirmationStarted`
- `EmailConfirmationCompleted`
- `EmailConfirmationFailed`
- `PasswordSignInStarted`
- `PasswordSignInCompleted`
- `GoogleSignInStarted`
- `GoogleSignInCompleted`
- `SignInPostProcessingCompleted`
- `SignInFailureProcessed`
- `PasswordResetRequested`
- `PasswordResetRequestFailed`
- `PasswordResetOtpSent`
- `PasswordResetCompleted`
- `PasswordResetCompletionFailed`
- `SignOutCompleted`
- `SessionRefreshCompleted`
- `SessionRefreshPostProcessingCompleted`
- `ProfileUpdateCompleted`
- `ProfileUpdateFailed`
- `AvatarUploadCompleted`
- `AvatarUploadFailed`

### Notifications

- `EmailNotificationSent`

### Deferred / intentionally unused right now

These names may exist conceptually, but are not part of the preferred current auth/profile custom-event story:

- request-side `PasswordSignInFailed` / `GoogleSignInFailed` events, because sign-in uses `SignInFailureProcessed` as the explicit failure signal

## Failure Reason Catalog

Current shared failure reasons:

- `already_confirmed`
- `duplicate_email`
- `duplicate_google_account`
- `invalid_file`
- `invalid_google_token`
- `invalid_otp`
- `not_authenticated`
- `stakeholder_not_found`
- `user_not_found`
- `validation_failed`

Additional sign-in failure processing uses the existing domain failure reasons from `UserSignInFailureReasons`, such as:

- invalid credentials
- locked out
- email not verified
- user not found

Those remain valid because they are already part of the domain contract used by `UserSignInFailed`.

## Flow Mapping

## Grafana Dashboard Plan

For the implemented scope, use three dashboards.

### 1. Authentication Overview

Purpose:

- business success visibility for sign-up, sign-in, confirmation, password reset, refresh, and sign-out

Recommended top-row stat panels:

- password sign-up completed count
- Google sign-up completed count
- email confirmation completed count
- password sign-in completed count
- Google sign-in completed count
- password reset completed count
- session refresh completed count

Recommended time-series panels:

- `PasswordSignUpStarted` vs `PasswordSignUpCompleted`
- `GoogleSignUpStarted` vs `GoogleSignUpCompleted`
- `EmailConfirmationStarted` vs `EmailConfirmationCompleted`
- `PasswordSignInStarted` vs `PasswordSignInCompleted`
- `GoogleSignInStarted` vs `GoogleSignInCompleted`
- `PasswordResetRequested` vs `PasswordResetOtpSent` vs `PasswordResetCompleted`
- `SessionRefreshCompleted` vs `SessionRefreshPostProcessingCompleted`

### 2. Authentication Failures And Security

Purpose:

- understand where auth journeys stop and why

Recommended panels:

- count of explicit auth failure events
- sign-up failures by `failure_reason`
- email confirmation failures by `failure_reason`
- password reset failures by `failure_reason`
- sign-in failure processed count by domain failure reason
- account-lock notifications triggered over time

Recommended table panels:

- recent auth journeys grouped by `flow.id`
- recent failed auth journeys grouped by `correlation_id`

### 3. Profile And Account Management

Purpose:

- track authenticated profile operations

Recommended panels:

- `ProfileUpdateCompleted` over time
- `AvatarUploadCompleted` over time
- profile-related failures by `failure_reason`
- avatar-related failures by `failure_reason`

## Funnel Definitions

These are the derived funnels Grafana should compute from events.

### Registration funnel

Stages:

1. `PasswordSignUpStarted` or `GoogleSignUpStarted`
2. `PasswordSignUpCompleted` or `GoogleSignUpCompleted`
3. `EmailConfirmationOtpSent` for password sign-up only
4. `EmailConfirmationCompleted` where applicable
5. `PasswordSignInCompleted` or `GoogleSignInCompleted`

### Password reset funnel

Stages:

1. `PasswordResetRequested`
2. `PasswordResetOtpSent`
3. `PasswordResetCompleted`

### Sign-in funnel

Stages:

1. `PasswordSignInStarted` or `GoogleSignInStarted`
2. `PasswordSignInCompleted` or `GoogleSignInCompleted`
3. `SignInPostProcessingCompleted`

## Derived Metrics

These are the first derived metrics to compute from business events.

- password sign-up completion rate
- Google sign-up completion rate
- email confirmation completion rate
- password sign-in completion rate
- Google sign-in completion rate
- password reset completion rate
- session refresh post-processing completion rate

Suggested formulas:

- password sign-up completion rate = `PasswordSignUpCompleted / PasswordSignUpStarted`
- Google sign-up completion rate = `GoogleSignUpCompleted / GoogleSignUpStarted`
- email confirmation completion rate = `EmailConfirmationCompleted / EmailConfirmationStarted`
- password sign-in completion rate = `PasswordSignInCompleted / PasswordSignInStarted`
- Google sign-in completion rate = `GoogleSignInCompleted / GoogleSignInStarted`
- password reset completion rate = `PasswordResetCompleted / PasswordResetRequested`
- session refresh post-processing completion rate = `SessionRefreshPostProcessingCompleted / SessionRefreshCompleted`

## SLO And Alert Definitions

These are the current SLO targets represented in the provisioned dashboards and Grafana-managed alert rules. They are deliberately pragmatic starting values and should be tuned against real production baselines.

### Authentication SLOs

- Password sign-up completion rate: `PasswordSignUpCompleted / PasswordSignUpStarted >= 95%` over 30 minutes.
- Email confirmation completion rate: `EmailConfirmationCompleted / EmailConfirmationStarted >= 90%` over 1 hour.
- Password sign-in completion rate: `PasswordSignInCompleted / PasswordSignInStarted >= 95%` over 15 minutes.
- Password reset completion rate: `PasswordResetCompleted / PasswordResetRequested >= 90%` over 30 minutes.
- Session refresh post-processing completion rate: `SessionRefreshPostProcessingCompleted / SessionRefreshCompleted >= 99%` over 15 minutes.

### Profile SLOs

- Profile update success rate: `ProfileUpdateCompleted / (ProfileUpdateCompleted + ProfileUpdateFailed) >= 99%` over 30 minutes.
- Avatar upload success rate: `AvatarUploadCompleted / (AvatarUploadCompleted + AvatarUploadFailed) >= 98%` over 30 minutes.
- Profile endpoint 5xx rate: less than 1% over 10 minutes.
- Profile endpoint p95 latency: less than 500 ms over 10 minutes.

### Alert Definitions

- Sign-in failure processed count exceeds 20 events in 15 minutes.
- Auth 5xx rate is greater than 1% for 10 minutes.
- Auth 429 rate exceeds 0.05 requests per second for 15 minutes.
- Password reset completion failures exceed 5 events in 15 minutes.
- Email confirmation failures exceed 10 events in 15 minutes.

The provisioned local/dev alert rules use starter fixed thresholds where a baseline comparison is not yet available:

- Auth 429 rate greater than `0.05` requests per second for 15 minutes.
- Sign-in failure processed count greater than `20` events in 15 minutes.

Provisioned alerts intentionally use only existing business custom events and existing HTTP metrics. They do not add new telemetry payloads, technical-health custom events, counters, stopwatch timing, or extra instrumentation.

## Query Expectations

The current local observability stack uses:

- OTLP gRPC from services to an OpenTelemetry Collector
- OTLP gRPC from the collector to Tempo for traces
- OTLP HTTP from the collector to Loki for structured logs
- Grafana with provisioned `Prometheus`, `Tempo`, and `Loki` datasources

`AddCustomEvent(...)` writes both:

- span events for trace correlation
- structured JSON log records for LogQL business-event queries

The current query shape supports:

- counts by event name
- counts by event name filtered by `failure_reason`
- grouping by `tenant_id`
- filtering by `flow.id`
- filtering by `correlation_id`
- grouping by time buckets

The datasource contract must support:

- searching a single journey with `flow.id`
- drilling from event count to concrete event records
- correlating request-side and consumer-side events with the same `flow.id`

## Technical Health Layer

The business custom events above do not replace technical telemetry.

Technical health should stay separate from business custom events. The currently supported technical layer is limited to existing OpenTelemetry/Prometheus signals:

- HTTP latency and status codes
- exceptions by type

## Current Status

### Implemented now

- shared event names
- shared failure-reason constants
- `flow.id` header propagation for WebAPI
- `flow.id` propagation through commands and events
- consumer enforcement that shared messages must inherit from `BaseCommand` or `BaseEvent`
- milestone custom events for the implemented auth/profile scope
- explicit business failure custom events for sign-up, email confirmation, password reset, profile update, and avatar upload
- structured business-event logs for `AddCustomEvent(...)`
- Loki datasource provisioning
- Grafana dashboard JSON for authentication overview, authentication failures/security, and profile/account management
- LogQL panel queries for the currently emitted auth/profile events
- derived rate panels for current auth/profile dashboards
- SLO target panels for current auth/profile dashboards
- alert definition panels for current auth/security dashboards
- Grafana-managed alert rules for current auth/profile SLOs and starter failure thresholds

### Still pending

- explicit security panels such as failed sign-ins by IP/email
- payment observability design and implementation

## Next Follow-Up

The next observability deliverable after this spec should be one of:

1. stronger security analytics using safe identifiers, such as hashed email/IP values where appropriate
2. payment observability design and implementation once payment workflows exist

Do not expand custom-event payloads ad hoc while doing that follow-up work. Keep changes aligned with this document unless the observability contract is intentionally revised first.
